# [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC)

This repository contains a Kubernetes operator that can be used to manage ZNC Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

This project uses the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) to
perform the necessary scaffolding and the code generation to set up the operator.
